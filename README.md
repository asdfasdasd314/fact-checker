# Government Fact Checker

**Goal**: Use AI to take text evidence from government documents to answer questions about the American government

**Motivation**: We live in a time of pervasive misinformation, and while some of that may in fact come from the government, if we trust organizations like the FBI and CIA to reveal the truth then the original sources are the best places to look for the truth, and using this software hopefully that truth is easier to uncover.
